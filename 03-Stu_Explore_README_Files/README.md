# Explore README.md Files

## Introduction

GitHub is a great way to showcase work so that it can be used by others, and so that employers can see your high-quality projects. However, without a well-written `README.md` file, a repository is just a pile of text files that is tedious to interpret.

In this activity, you’ll work in groups to review `README.md` files for two GitHub repos, and then share suggestions for making them easier to read and understand.

## Instructions

1. Go to the [trending page](https://github.com/trending?spoken_language_code=en) on GitHub and choose a repository to explore. Pick something that interests you and your team.

2. Review the `README.md` file and discuss the following with your group:

    * What do you like about this `README.md`?

    * What do you not like?

    * Is there anything you find confusing?

3. As you explore the `README.md` file, consider the following:

    * Does the text of the `README.md` make you excited to learn more about the project?

    * Is it clear who the intended audience is?

    * Does the `README.md` provide enough information?

    * Does it provide too much information?

4. After you have discussed the `README.md` file with your group, pick a second repository and then compare the two `README.md` files.
