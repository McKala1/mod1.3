## Introduction

In this activity, you will create a new repository, clone it, and add files via command line.

## Instructions

2. Using the repo that we just created, make or add the following changes:

  * Add new lines of text to the `README.md` file.

  * Create a new folder.

  * Add a file to the newly created folder.

  * Add, commit, and push the changes.

  * Delete the new folder.

  * Add, commit, and push the changes again.
