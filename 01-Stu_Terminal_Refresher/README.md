# Terminal Refresher

## Introduction

Now, it's your turn to do some work in the Terminal. You'll create three folders and some markdown files, then add text to the files.

## Instructions

Use the following instructions to write commands in your terminal:

1. Create a folder called `Meal_Routine`.

2. Navigate into the folder.

3. Inside `Meal_Routine`, create another folder called `Breakfast`.

4. Inside `Breakfast`, create a file called `breakfast_routine.md`.

5. In `breakfast_routine.md`, add a sentence or two summarizing your breakfast routine.

6. Return to the `Meal_Routine` folder.

7. Inside `Meal_Routine`, create another folder called `Lunch`.

8. Inside `Lunch`, create a file called `lunch_routine.md`.

9. In `lunch_routine.md`, add a sentence or two summarizing your lunch routine.

10. Return to the `Meal_Routine` folder.

11. Inside `Meal_Routine`, create a third folder called `Dinner`.

12. Inside `Dinner`, create a file called `dinner_routine.md`.

13. In `dinner_routine.md`, add a sentence or two summarizing your dinner routine.

> **Remember** It's always okay to ask for help if you get stuck.
